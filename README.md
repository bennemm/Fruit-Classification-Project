# Fruit-Classification-Project
Capstone Project for RoboGarden Machine Learning Bootcamp
1. CNN From Scratch:\
a. Jupyter Noetbook is called Fruits_CNN.ipynb \
b. The "best model" is called Best_Fruit_CNN0model.h5 \
The "best model" can be loaded into the Jupyter notebook so that the model does not need to be retrained. \ 
c. cnn_block.png is a block diagram of the model.\
d. The accompanying word document is called CNN_Model Documentation.docx
2. Transfer Leraning \
a. Jupyter Notebook is called Fruits-VGG16.ipynb \
b. The "best model" is called "Best_Fruit_CNN8_VGG16model.h5 \
The "best model" can be loaded into the Jupyter notebook so that the model does not need to be retrained. \
c. vgg_block.png is a block diagram of the model. \
d. The accompanying word document is called Transfer Learning Project Documentation.docx
